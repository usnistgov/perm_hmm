The following routines are minor adaptations of code from the pyro project,
and thus the Apache 2.0 license applies to the methods listed below. For each
listed method, the modifications made to the methods are discussed.

perm_hmm.models.hmms.DiscreteHMM.log_prob: This method is a minor adaptation of
the method pyro.distributions.DiscreteHMM.log_prob.
The modification made is to the starting point of the hidden Markov model.
By shifting the index of the initial state distribution, perm_hmm.models.hmms.DiscreteHMM.log_prob
effectively shifts the starting point of the hidden Markov model relative to
that in the pyro package. The difference is that, while in the pyro package the initial state
is not sampled from, here it is.

perm_hmm.models.hmms.DiscreteHMM.posterior_log_initial_state_dist: This method
reuses some lines of code from the log_prob method of the pyro.distributions.DiscreteHMM.log_prob,
but in a different context.

The following license applies to the above methods:
